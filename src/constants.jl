# These are internal ScopedValues used to control the behavior of `extract_latlon_coords!`. They are mirrored by keys of the same name in the `PLOT_SETTINGS` Dict which is also a ScopedValue and should be from users to control the behavior of `extract_latlon_coords!`.

const INSERT_NAN = ScopedValue{Bool}(true)
#= 
Specify whether `extract_latlon_coords!` should potentially add artificial points between each pair of input points in order to have lines appear straight on scattergeo plots. This can have a symbol and three valid values (In reality, every symbol that is not the first two will be treated as `:NONE`)
- `:NORMAL` will add artificial points only when necessary (when distance between points is too large) and will create lines that never cross the antimeridian. This is useful for example to plot Box geometries with large areas and have them still look like boxes.
- `:SHORT` will add artificial points like per `:NORMAL` but will also make sure the line drawn between the points is the shortest one (potentially crossing the antimeridian at 180Â° longitude).
- `:NONE` will not add artificial points
